    "Answer 1:  Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Explanation: Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. It encompasses various techniques and approaches to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and learning from experiences.\n",
    "Example: A chatbot that provides customer support by understanding and responding to inquiries in natural language, such as answering questions about products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Explanation: Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It involves techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "Example: An email spam filter that learns to classify emails as spam or non-spam based on examples provided by the user, improving its accuracy over time as it encounters new emails.\n",
