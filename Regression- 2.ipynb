    "Ans 3 :Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use in situations where you want to compare regression models with different numbers of predictors or when you want to guard against overfitting. Here are some specific scenarios where adjusted R-squared is particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing models with different numbers of predictors: When you're considering multiple regression models with different sets of predictors, it's essential to use adjusted R-squared for comparison. Regular R-squared tends to increase as more predictors are added, even if those predictors don't actually improve the model's explanatory power. Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictors, providing a fairer comparison between models with different complexities.\n",
    "Guarding against overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns. Regular R-squared may overestimate the performance of overfitted models because it tends to increase with the addition of more predictors. Adjusted R-squared penalizes overfitting by considering the number of predictors in the model. Models with high regular R-squared but low adjusted R-squared may be overfitted.\n",
    "Interpreting model complexity: Adjusted R-squared helps in understanding the trade-off between model complexity and goodness of fit. As you add more predictors to a model, regular R-squared will typically increase, even if those predictors are not adding much explanatory power. Adjusted R-squared provides a more conservative assessment by adjusting for the number of predictors. It helps you determine whether the improvement in model fit justifies the added complexity.\n",
    "Selecting the best-fitting model: When comparing multiple regression models, adjusted R-squared can help identify the model that strikes the right balance between goodness of fit and model simplicity. Models with higher adjusted R-squared values are preferred because they explain a larger proportion of the variance in the dependent variable while considering the number of predictors included."
