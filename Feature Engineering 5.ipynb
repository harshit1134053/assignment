    "Answer 1 : Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical format, but they differ in their application and the type of categorical variables they are suitable for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is used when there is a clear ordinal relationship or hierarchy among the categories of a categorical variable. In ordinal encoding, each category is mapped to a unique integer value based on its position in the ordinal sequence. This means that the encoded values have a specific order that reflects the ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a categorical variable \"Education Level\" with the categories: \"High School\", \"College\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", and \"PhD\". These categories have a clear ordinal relationship, where \"PhD\" > \"Master's\" > \"Bachelor's\" > \"College\" > \"High School\". In this case, we can use ordinal encoding to assign integer values to the categories based on their position in the ordinal sequence: \"High School\" = 1, \"College\" = 2, \"Bachelor's\" = 3, \"Master's\" = 4, and \"PhD\" = 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is a more general technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical format when there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories. In label encoding, each category is mapped to a unique integer value without considering any ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a categorical variable \"City\" with the categories: \"New York\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Chicago\", and \"Houston\". These categories do not have a clear ordinal relationship. In this case, we can use label encoding to assign integer values to the categories: \"New York\" = 1, \"Los Angeles\" = 2, \"Chicago\" = 3, and \"Houston\" = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing Between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has a clear ordinal relationship among its categories, as ordinal encoding preserves this ordinal information in the encoded values. On the other hand, you might choose label encoding when there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories, as label encoding simply assigns integer values to the categories without implying any ordinal relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between ordinal encoding and label encoding lies in the type of categorical variables they are suitable for and whether or not there is a clear ordinal relationship among the categories.\n",

    "Answer 2 : Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable (dependent variable) in a supervised machine learning problem. This encoding method assigns ordinal labels to categories based on the mean or median of the target variable for each category. It leverages the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable to encode the categories in a way that reflects their importance or impact on the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Mean/Median Target Value for Each Category: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the mean or median of the target variable (dependent variable). This provides a measure of the average target value for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Ordinal Labels: Sort the categories based on their mean or median target value in ascending or descending order. Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their position in the sorted list. The category with the lowest mean or median target value gets assigned the lowest ordinal label, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode the Categorical Variable: Replace the original categorical variable with the ordinal labels assigned to each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing information about students and their performance on a test. One of the features in the dataset is \"Education Level\" with categories: \"High School\", \"College\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", and \"PhD\". We want to predict whether a student will pass or fail the test based on their education level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean or median test score for each education level category.\n",
    "Sort the categories based on their mean or median test score.\n",
    "Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their position in the sorted list. For example, if \"PhD\" has the highest mean test score, it would be assigned the highest ordinal label (e.g., 5), and so on.\n",
    "Replace the original \"Education Level\" categorical variable with the ordinal labels.\n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a categorical variable with a natural order or hierarchy, but you want to encode it based on its relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "You want to capture the impact of each category of the categorical variable on the target variable by encoding them in a way that reflects their importance or influence.\n",
    "You believe that the mean or median target value for each category provides meaningful information about the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable."
