    "Answer1: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It serves as a central repository for storing and retrieving information efficiently. Databases are commonly used in various applications, including websites, mobile apps, enterprise systems, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases are two different types of databases that are designed to handle different types of data and workloads. Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. Each table consists of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using foreign key constraints.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for performing operations such as querying, updating, and managing data.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: SQL databases typically follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity and transaction management.\n",
    "Scaling: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can be scaled up by adding more resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) to a single server.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that can store data in various formats, including key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs. They are schema-less, meaning each record can have its own structure.\n",
    "Query Language: NoSQL databases may not use SQL as the primary query language. Instead, they often provide their own query interfaces or APIs tailored to specific data models.\n",
    "CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and prioritize scalability and flexibility over strict consistency. They often adhere to the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) theorem, which states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three of these properties at any given time.\n",
    "Scaling: NoSQL databases are generally horizontally scalable, meaning they can be scaled out across multiple servers or nodes in a distributed manner to handle increasing data volumes and traffic.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, etc."

    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are both important concepts in relational databases, used to establish and maintain relationships between tables. Here's an explanation of each:\n",

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row or record in that table.\n",
    "It must contain unique values for each row and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "By defining a Primary Key, you ensure data integrity and enforce entity integrity constraints in the table.\n",
    "Typically, Primary Keys are used to link or reference records in other tables through Foreign Keys.\n",
    "In most databases, a Primary Key is implemented using an index, which allows for fast lookup and retrieval of data.\n",
    "Primary Keys can be composed of a single column or multiple columns (composite keys) if necessary to ensure uniqueness.\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "Foreign Key:\n",

    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link or relationship between two tables.\n",

    "Foreign Keys can have NULL values, indicating that a particular row in the child table may not have a corresponding parent row.\n",
    "When a Foreign Key is defined, it can be accompanied by actions such as CASCADE, which specifies what happens to related rows in the child table when corresponding rows in the parent table are updated or deleted.\n",
